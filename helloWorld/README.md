The purpose of the helloWorld example application is to illustrate how the HTML, Javascript and CSS code can be stored in separate files instead of embedding the HTML within main.go and embedding the Javascript and CSS within index.html.

Clicking on the "Click me" button should result in "Hello, World!" (in red) appearing on the screen.
