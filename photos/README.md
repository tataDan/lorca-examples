The purpose of the photos example application is to illustrate how the Go image package can be used to process image files (e.g. *.jpg files).

The images are stored in a HTML img element. If you click on the "Create a grayscale file and store it on your hard drive" button, the Go code will create a grayscale version of the displayed color image and store it on your hard drive. For example, if the displayed image is "flowersAndMountains.jpg", the application will create a file named "GS_flowersAndMountains.jpg" and store it on your hard drive.

Clicking on either the "Reduce size by half" button or the "Resize to normal size" button will invoke Javascript code to implement the respective request.
