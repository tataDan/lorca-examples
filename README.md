The examples in this repository are desktop applications written in the Go programming language (https://golang.org/) and which are based on the Lorca library (https://github.com/zserge/lorca). This means that you might need to enter "go get github.com/zserge/lorca" from a terminal before running the example applications. Additionally, you might need to enter "go get github.com/ncruces/zenity" in order to run the simpleGrep example application. For the example applications to run, it is necessary to have either the Chrome or Chromium web browser installed.

The initial six example applications are "helloWorld", "photos", "database", "mimicDatabase", "pigGame", and "simpleGrep".

The initial six example applications all use Go, HTML, Javascript and CSS, and all have files named "main.go", "index.html", "script.js", "style.css", and "README.md" in their respective folders.
